    "# M77 Coursework: 3D \"Pac-Man\"\n",
    "The following coursework is designed to test multiple components of the module sylabus; including 3D geometry, object detection, feature extraction and image manipulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to complete the below skeleton code to play a Pac-Man-esque game in 3D. You are allowed to utilise method discussed in the course, including feature extractors and deep learning approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of the coursework is to step through a 3D pointcloud of the old PhD lab at Swansea University. Several large spheres have been placed within the space, it is your job to move through the pointcloud in an automated fashion, detecting the location of the sphere and moving to the predicted 3D location. If you land close enough to a sphere it will be captured and removed from the pointcloud. \n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to decide what kinds of feature you want to use, extract these features and train a classifier to detect the spheres within an image. You can then use the functionality provided in the PacMan_functionality.py module to obtain the XYZ coordinates of the pixel you predict to be a sphere.\n"
